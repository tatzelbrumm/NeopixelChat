You: 

does a WS2812B Neopixel control brightness by a current DAC or by PWM?

ChatGPT: 

The **WS2812B Neopixel**  controls brightness using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**  rather than a current Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).
### How It Works: 
 
- Each LED in a WS2812B contains a tiny controller that adjusts the brightness of the Red, Green, and Blue channels via **PWM** .
 
- The PWM signal rapidly turns the LEDs on and off, and the **duty cycle**  (the proportion of time the signal is "on" within a cycle) determines the perceived brightness.

- The human eye averages these rapid on-off cycles, perceiving a continuous brightness level.

### Why PWM? 
 
- **Efficiency** : PWM is more power-efficient than varying the current, as the LED is either fully on or off, minimizing heat loss.
 
- **Simplicity** : It simplifies the circuit design within the chip.

Would you like more details on how the WS2812B controls its PWM signal or how to program it?

[WS2812B Datasheet - Adafruit Industries
cdn-shop.adafruit.com](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) The WS2812B is an intelligent control LED light source that integrates a control circuit and RGB chip into a 5050 package. It utilizes Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of each color channel. The duty cycle of the PWM signal determines the perceived brightness, with each channel capable of 256 brightness levels, allowing for a full-color display of 16,777,216 colors.

You: 

Is the same functionality also available in a through hole package?
What are the available sizes … 5 mm diameter, 3 mm, 1.8 mm, … ?

ChatGPT: 

Yes, the functionality of the WS2812B, which integrates an RGB LED with a control circuit, is available in through-hole packages. These through-hole WS2812B LEDs are commonly found in two sizes:
 
- **5mm Diameter** : Standard LED size, suitable for various applications.
 
- **8mm Diameter** : Larger size, providing increased brightness and visibility.

These LEDs are available with either diffused or clear lenses, allowing for different lighting effects. For example, SparkFun Electronics offers these variants:
 
- **5mm Diffused** : Provides a softer, more uniform light.
 
- **5mm Clear** : Offers a sharper, more focused light.
 
- **8mm Diffused** : Larger size with a diffused lens for broader illumination.

Currently, 3mm and 1.8mm diameter versions of WS2812B LEDs are not commonly available. The 5mm and 8mm sizes are the standard options for through-hole WS2812B LEDs.
