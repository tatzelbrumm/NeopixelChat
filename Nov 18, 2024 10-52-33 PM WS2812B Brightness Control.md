You: 

does a WS2812B Neopixel control brightness by a current DAC or by PWM?

ChatGPT: 

The **WS2812B Neopixel**  controls brightness using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**  rather than a current Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).
### How It Works: 
 
- Each LED in a WS2812B contains a tiny controller that adjusts the brightness of the Red, Green, and Blue channels via **PWM** .
 
- The PWM signal rapidly turns the LEDs on and off, and the **duty cycle**  (the proportion of time the signal is "on" within a cycle) determines the perceived brightness.

- The human eye averages these rapid on-off cycles, perceiving a continuous brightness level.

### Why PWM? 
 
- **Efficiency** : PWM is more power-efficient than varying the current, as the LED is either fully on or off, minimizing heat loss.
 
- **Simplicity** : It simplifies the circuit design within the chip.

[WS2812B Datasheet - Adafruit Industries
cdn-shop.adafruit.com](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) The WS2812B is an intelligent control LED light source that integrates a control circuit and RGB chip into a 5050 package. It utilizes Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of each color channel. The duty cycle of the PWM signal determines the perceived brightness, with each channel capable of 256 brightness levels, allowing for a full-color display of 16,777,216 colors.

You: 

Is the same functionality also available in a through hole package?
What are the available sizes … 5 mm diameter, 3 mm, 1.8 mm, … ?

ChatGPT: 

Yes, the functionality of the WS2812B, which integrates an RGB LED with a control circuit, is available in through-hole packages. These through-hole WS2812B LEDs are commonly found in two sizes:
 
- **5mm Diameter** : Standard LED size, suitable for various applications.
 
- **8mm Diameter** : Larger size, providing increased brightness and visibility.

These LEDs are available with either diffused or clear lenses, allowing for different lighting effects. For example, SparkFun Electronics offers these variants:
 
- **5mm Diffused** : Provides a softer, more uniform light.
 
- **5mm Clear** : Offers a sharper, more focused light.
 
- **8mm Diffused** : Larger size with a diffused lens for broader illumination.

Currently, 3mm and 1.8mm diameter versions of WS2812B LEDs are not commonly available. The 5mm and 8mm sizes are the standard options for through-hole WS2812B LEDs.

You: 

I'm too lazy to read the data sheets in full detail right now … do the WS2812B LEDs have built-in gamma correction?
What's That Gamma Correction Stuff All About, Anyhow?

ChatGPT: 

No, **WS2812B LEDs do not have built-in gamma correction** . The data signal sent to WS2812B LEDs directly controls the brightness levels of the red, green, and blue channels using an 8-bit value (0-255) for each channel. However, this linear control doesn't account for the human eye's non-linear perception of brightness.
### What's Gamma Correction? 
**Gamma correction**  adjusts the brightness levels to match how humans perceive light intensity. Our eyes are more sensitive to changes in dark tones than in bright tones. Without gamma correction, the perceived brightness of an LED may not scale smoothly from 0 to 100%.
#### Linear vs. Gamma-Corrected Brightness: 
 
- **Linear Brightness** : If you increase the brightness by equal steps (e.g., 0, 64, 128, 192, 255), the changes seem uneven to the human eye. The dark-to-midrange jumps feel more pronounced, while mid-to-bright changes appear subtler.
 
- **Gamma Correction** : Applies a mathematical curve to the brightness values so that the visual change appears more uniform. A typical gamma correction function raises the input value to a power (commonly **2.2**  for displays).

### Why Use Gamma Correction? 
 
1. **Visual Consistency** : Without gamma correction, transitions between brightness levels can look harsh or unnatural.
 
2. **Color Accuracy** : Colors can appear washed out or overly intense, as the RGB mix doesn’t align well with human vision.
 
3. **Improved Gradients** : Ensures smooth color transitions, especially in animations or dim lighting.

### How to Implement Gamma Correction? 

Since WS2812B LEDs lack built-in gamma correction, you can apply it in software before sending data:
 
- Use a **lookup table (LUT)**  or calculate the gamma-corrected value on the fly.
 
- For each input brightness level, transform it using:
$$
 \text{Corrected Value} = 255 \times \left(\frac{\text{Input Value}}{255}\right)^{\gamma} 
$$

where $$\gamma$$ is typically around 2.2.

Would you like a code example or more detail on implementing gamma correction?

You: 

Why not … Arduino, using #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>, please.

ChatGPT: 

Here's a simple example to apply **gamma correction**  when using **Adafruit_NeoPixel**  on an Arduino. The Adafruit_NeoPixel library has built-in support for gamma correction, but I'll show how to manually implement it if you'd like more control.
### Option 1: Using Built-in Gamma Correction 

The Adafruit_NeoPixel library includes a gamma correction table, and you can use it directly:


```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN 6        // Pin where the NeoPixel strip is connected
#define NUMPIXELS 16 // Number of LEDs in the strip

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  strip.begin();
  strip.show(); // Initialize all pixels to 'off'
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) {
    uint8_t red = 50;    // Example brightness
    uint8_t green = 20;  // Example brightness
    uint8_t blue = 100;  // Example brightness

    // Apply built-in gamma correction
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(strip.gamma8(red), strip.gamma8(green), strip.gamma8(blue)));
  }
  strip.show();
  delay(500);
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Gamma Correction with a Custom Table 

If you want to manually implement your gamma correction:
 
1. **Create a gamma correction lookup table:**


```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN 6
#define NUMPIXELS 16

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

// Gamma correction table (example for gamma = 2.2)
uint8_t gammaTable[256];

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
    gammaTable[i] = pow((float)i / 255.0, 2.2) * 255.0;
  }

  strip.begin();
  strip.show();
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) {
    uint8_t red = 50;
    uint8_t green = 20;
    uint8_t blue = 100;

    // Apply gamma correction manually using the table
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(gammaTable[red], gammaTable[green], gammaTable[blue]));
  }
  strip.show();
  delay(500);
}
```

### Key Points: 
 
- **Built-in `gamma8`** : Quick and easy for most cases.
 
- **Manual LUT** : Allows customization, for instance, using different gamma values.
